# Research: Generic Task Runner

## Summary

No specific research was required for this feature. The initial user request provided a comprehensive and detailed technical specification, including two potential implementation strategies (sequential and parallel). The "State-of-the-Art" parallel implementation was chosen as the target.

All necessary information regarding the architecture, data model, and core logic was contained within the original prompt. Therefore, no external lookups or clarifications were needed to proceed with the implementation plan.
